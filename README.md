# The "Layered_TB" Project
The `Layered_TB` is a project, which was a requirement for passing the `Functional Verification` subject at university. <br>
Layered testbench is provided by the subject leader. <br>
The Design Under Test and the requirements are provided by one of the students. In this case DUT belongs to: `KaeM-Projects`.
For verification the free version of Vivado has been used.

## The purpose of this project:
+ To familiarize with the UVM methodology by usage of layered testbench.
+ To adjust the testbench to the provided DUT.
+ To verify whether DUT behaves like it was specified in requirements.
+ To report any faults in provided design.

## What has been done
+ First of all, the provided requirements were rewritten to a precise form and errors were taken care of.
+ Research about the UVM methodology was performed.
+ The Golden Circuit that meets the requirements has been created.
+ The testbench was adjusted for the DUT.
+ Transactions were added.
+ The Scoreboard fault/success reporting was added.
+ Sequences were added.
+ Test were added.   
+ Report was made.
